# Black History Facts Generator
This web app displays a random Black History Fact every 10 seconds.

## About The Project
I wrote this app about two years ago (at least) usng Python and Flask. It started out as a project to display a random Black History fact during Black History Month.

## Updates
9/28/21: After translating the code into JavaScript/Node for another project I liked the frontend redesign that I copied it over to this project. Because of that I created a new version called "build_v1."
